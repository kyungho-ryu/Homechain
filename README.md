# Homechain : Ethereum-based real estate transaction management platform to prevent forgery

Because blockchain puts data in blocks and stores it in the form of a chain, it is possible to prevent forgery. Blockchain-based Ethereum can make various types of contracts, such as financial transactions and real estate transactions, through smart contracts. Among them, since real estate transactions are opaque, fraud by third parties such as real estate brokers frequently occurs. To solve this problem, if Ethereum is used, transparent transactions are possible without the Interference of public institutions or third parties. To this end, we developed an Ethereum-based real estate transaction management platform that prevents real estate fraud.
